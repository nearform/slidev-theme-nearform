## Extra tips

### Intro slide

If you want to have an image in the intro slide, you can modify the `slides.md`
header section:

```md
---
theme: slidev-theme-nearform
layout: image-right
image: https://source.unsplash.com/collection/94734566/1920x1080
---
```

The URL used in this example will return a different image every time, selected
from a curated collection. But, ideally, you should set a local file path for
the specified image.

If you don't want to set an image, use `layout: default`.

### Dense lists

Although you shouldn't write "dense" slides, some times it can be difficult to
avoid it. In such situations, you can apply the `dense` CSS class to your
`<div>` containers, to ensure that they fit in the available vertical space.
